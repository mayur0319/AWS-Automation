# Automated IAM Access Key Rotation with AWS Organizations

## Use Case
Protect your AWS accounts from compromised IAM access keys by automating their rotation regularly, a security best practice in IAM. This solution is designed specifically for AWS Organizations, allowing you to identify all AWS account IDs within your organization and apply rotation measures uniformly.

## Features
- **Automated Rotation:** New IAM access keys are generated when existing keys are older than 80 days.
- **Email Notifications:** Users receive new access keys in password-protected zip files via email notifications using the SES service.
- **Deactivation and Deletion:** Previous access keys are deactivated at 90 days and deleted at 100 days old.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Rotation, deletion, and deactivation periods can be customized.
- **Exclusion:** Specific AWS accounts can be excluded from rotation actions.
- **Initial Cleanup:** Performs an initial cleanup, deleting existing inactive keys older than 100 days.

## Technology Stack
- **Amazon Event Bridge**
- **IAM**
- **AWS Lambda**
- **AWS Organizations**
- **Amazon CloudWatch**
- **SES**
- **SNS**

## Prerequisites
- AWS Organizations configured and set up.
- Each IAM user should have a proper email ID tagged.
- Users can be excluded from rotation activity using a "Exempt" tag.
- Each account must have a "provisioning-admin" IAM role.
- Senderâ€™s Email ID configured into SES.
- SNS configured for Lambda execution failure notifications.
- Environment variables configured before running functionality.

## Configuration Details
- **Lambda Function Name:** iam-access-key-rotator
- **EventBridge Name:** iam-access_key_rotator-rule
- **EventBridge Schedule:** Invokes daily at 13:00 UTC.
- **SES Configuration Sets:** iam-access-key-rotator-configset
- **SNS Topic Name:** iam-access-key-rotator-topic
- **IAM Role:** iam-access-key-rotator-role

## Workflow
1. An EventBridge event initiates the Lambda function every 24 hours at 9 UTC.
2. The Lambda function assumes the "provisioning-admin" IAM role to access AWS Organizations and list down all AWS account IDs.
3. For each user, it processes the username, email ID, and access keys details.
4. Based on defined rules, it performs rotation actions.
5. Email notifications are sent via SES for rotation actions, including sharing new access keys in a password-protected zip file.
6. Initial cleanup deletes inactive keys older than 100 days.
